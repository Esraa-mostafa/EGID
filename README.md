# EGID Project

We all know the benefit of technology, the power of it, and we in very fast world and every millisecond make a difference. Our goal is to change the national ID to an electronic ID-card, design a database, design a digital signature system, give the appropriate authorization to each governmental entity and built an efficient and secure ecosystem that saves time and money. Then just scan the electronic ID-card through the computer in the appropriate form. All data will be automatically filled out. Lets get things done faster, easier and cheaper!
